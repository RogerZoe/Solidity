##  Solidity Practice Vault

This repo is my personal Solidity playground â€” a collection of smart contract examples, experiments, and learning exercises organized by concept. Everything here is built from scratch as I learn the building blocks of Ethereum smart contract development.

### Folder Structure (Topics Covered)

| Folder             | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **INTRODUCTION**   | Basic structure of Solidity, first steps, and hello-world contracts.          |
| **Data\_types**    | Practice with Solidity types: `uint`, `address`, `bool`, `string`, etc.       |
| **functions**      | Function visibility, parameters, returns, modifiers, overloading, etc.        |
| **MODIFERES**      | Custom modifiers, access control patterns, `onlyOwner`, and more.             |
| **Events**         | Emitting and listening to events, `indexed` keyword usage.                    |
| **Error\_hNDLING** | `require()`, `assert()`, `revert()`, custom error messages.                   |
| **INHERITANCE**    | Contract inheritance, overriding, `super` keyword.                            |
| **Immutability**   | Immutable vs constant variables.                                              |
| **Interface**      | Using and creating interfaces for interaction between contracts.              |
| **Visibility**     | Function and state variable visibility: `public`, `private`, `internal`, etc. |
| **Mapping**        | Nested mappings, mapping to structs, and advanced mapping use-cases.          |
| **EXTRA**          | Miscellaneous concepts and edge cases.                                        |
| **PROJECTS**       | Small end-to-end mini-projects built using the concepts above.                |
| **Security**       | Security practices, reentrancy attack demo, and safe patterns.                |
| **Rough**          | Sandbox for messy experimentation â€” not everything will compile ðŸ˜„            |

###  Why This Repo Exists

I'm learning Solidity hands-on by writing code. Instead of watching 100 videos and forgetting everything, Iâ€™m:

* Writing contracts for each concept,
* Breaking them on purpose,
* Fixing them by understanding *why* they broke.
